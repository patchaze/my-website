> **Note:** Embassy requirements change frequently. Always verify current requirements directly on the official embassy or consulate website of your destination country before applying. This article is educational guidance only — not legal advice.

## What Is the Schengen Area?

The Schengen Area is a zone of 27 European countries that have abolished passport controls at their mutual borders. A **Schengen tourist visa (Type C)** allows you to visit these countries for up to 90 days within any 180-day period.

Getting the document package right is the single most controllable factor in a successful application.

## The Core Schengen Visa Document Checklist

### 1. Valid Passport

Your passport must:
- Be valid for **at least 3 months beyond** your intended departure date from the Schengen Area
- Have **at least 2 blank pages** for stamps
- Have been **issued within the last 10 years**

If your passport is expiring soon, renew it before applying.

### 2. Completed Application Form

Download the **official Schengen Visa Application Form** from the VFS Global or official embassy website of your destination country. Fill it completely — no blank fields.

### 3. Recent Passport Photos

- **2 identical photos**, taken within the last 6 months
- White or off-white background
- Specific size requirements vary by embassy (typically 35mm x 45mm)

### 4. Travel Health Insurance

This is **mandatory** for all Schengen applications. Your insurance must:
- Cover the **entire Schengen Area** (not just your primary destination)
- Provide minimum **€30,000 coverage** for emergency medical care and repatriation
- Be valid for the **entire duration** of your stay

### 5. Flight Reservation (Not Booked Tickets)

Most embassies require a **flight reservation confirmation** — not necessarily purchased tickets. Use a verified reservation service, not a hand-crafted fake.

### 6. Hotel / Accommodation Proof

For every night of your stay, you need:
- **Hotel bookings** (reserve-refundable options are acceptable)
- **Airbnb confirmations** with host address
- **Invitation letter** (if staying with a host citizen)

### 7. Cover Letter / Personal Statement

A written explanation of your trip, covering:
- Purpose of travel
- Planned itinerary
- Financial means to support yourself
- Reasons you will return home (ties to your country)

[→ See our Cover Letter Strategy service](/services/cover-letter-strategy/)

### 8. Travel Itinerary

A day-by-day plan including:
- Which cities/countries you'll visit and when
- Accommodation addresses for each location
- Key activities or reasons for visits

### 9. Proof of Financial Means

Documents proving you can support yourself financially. Common requirements:
- **Bank statements** from the last 3–6 months
- **Minimum balance** (varies by country, typically €50–€100/day of stay)
- **Proof of employment / income** (salary slips, employment letter)
- **If sponsored**: sponsor's bank statements + signed sponsor declaration

[→ See our Financial Proof Review service](/services/financial-proof-review/)

### 10. Proof of Ties to Home Country

This is what proves you'll return home. Can include:
- Employment contract / employer letter
- Business ownership documents
- Property deed or rental agreement
- Family ties (marriage certificate, children's birth certificates)
- Enrollment in an educational institution

### 11. Proof of Civil Status

- Marriage certificate (if applicable)
- Birth certificates for dependent children

### 12. Additional Documents (Country-Specific)

Some embassies require additional items:
- For self-employed applicants: business registration, tax returns, accountant letter
- For students: enrollment letter + permission from school
- For retirees: pension statement

## After You've Gathered Everything

Before submitting, review your complete package for:
- ✅ Consistency — do all dates, names, and addresses match across documents?
- ✅ Completeness — is every required document present?
- ✅ Chronology — do your bank statements cover the correct period?

[→ Book a Document Review Session](/services/document-review/) to have a professional review your package before submission.
