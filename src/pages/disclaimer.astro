        <h2>1. Educational Purpose Only</h2>
        <p>
          DURIAN provides educational and informational content only. All content on this website,
          including blog posts, guides, resources, and services, is intended solely to educate applicants
          on the general process of preparing visa applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing on this website or provided through any of our services constitutes legal advice,
          legal guidance, or the practice of immigration law.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Not a Law Firm</h2>
        <p>
          DURIAN is not a law firm. No employee, contractor, or consultant of DURIAN
          is acting as your attorney. No attorney-client relationship is formed through any use of this
          website, its content, or its services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you require legal advice about your immigration status, eligibility, or rights,
          you must consult a qualified, licensed immigration attorney in your jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Not a Visa Agency</h2>
        <p>
          DURIAN is not a visa agency or a visa application service. We do not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Submit applications on your behalf</li>
          <li>Represent you before any embassy, consulate, or immigration authority</li>
          <li>Hold power of attorney or any equivalent authority</li>
          <li>Act as an immigration representative or authorised agent</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. No Guarantee of Approval</h2>
        <p>
          DURIAN makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee that following our guidance,
          using our services, or adopting our recommendations will result in a visa being granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visa decisions are made exclusively by embassy officers and consular officials based on their
          assessment of your application and current policies. We have no influence over these decisions.
          No consultant, service, or agency can legally guarantee visa approval.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Accuracy and Currency of Information</h2>
        <p>
          Embassy requirements, visa policies, and documentary requirements change frequently.
          While we strive to keep our content accurate and up to date, DURIAN cannot
          guarantee the ongoing accuracy or completeness of any information published on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Always verify current requirements directly on the official website of the relevant
          embassy or consulate before submitting any application.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, DURIAN and its consultants shall not be
          liable for any loss, damage, visa refusal, financial cost, or other consequence arising
          from your use of our services, your reliance on any content published on this website,
          or any decision you make based on information provided by DURIAN.
        </p>

        <h2>7. No Refund Policy for Consular Refusals</h2>
        <p>
          Our services are billed for time, guidance, and education — not for visa outcomes.
          Refusals of visa applications are not grounds for refund of our service fees.
        </p>
