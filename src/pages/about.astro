      <p class="hero-sm__subtitle">
        A pharmacist who fell in love with travel — and discovered that most people struggle
        with visa applications not because they're unqualified, but because the process is opaque.

      <h2>Why DURIAN Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Applying for a Schengen visa shouldn't feel like gambling. But for millions of people every year,
        it does. The requirements are scattered across embassy websites, appointment slots disappear overnight,
        and one missing document can mean a refusal stamp in your passport.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DURIAN Travel was born from personal frustration.</strong> After going through the process
        myself — and watching friends get refused for entirely preventable reasons — I decided to build
        the resource I wished had existed.
      </p>

      <h2>Founder Background</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Patricia. I'm a licensed pharmacist with a career built on precision, documentation,
        and attention to detail. Those same skills apply directly to visa applications — where every document
        matters and every inconsistency can raise a flag.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've traveled to multiple Schengen countries, navigated the visa process firsthand, and studied
        the official requirements from dozens of embassies. I combine that experience with a pharmacist's
        methodical approach to help others prepare stronger applications.
      </p>

        <span>⚠️</span>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> I am not an immigration lawyer. I do not submit visa applications.
          I do not guarantee approvals. I provide educational guidance and document review to help you
          prepare — the decision is always the embassy's.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Our Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Honesty over hype.</strong> We never promise approvals. We tell you what's strong and what's weak.</li>
        <li><strong>Education first.</strong> Our goal is for you to understand the process, not depend on us.</li>
        <li><strong>Detail matters.</strong> One missing bank statement can cost months. We catch those details.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible pricing.</strong> Quality guidance shouldn't cost thousands. Services start at €29.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What We Cover</h2>
      <p>
        Our core expertise is <strong>Schengen tourist visa applications</strong>, but we also provide guidance on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Travel health preparation (medications, prescriptions, vaccines)</li>
        <li>Trip itinerary and accommodation planning</li>
        <li>Packing, carry-on rules, and airport security</li>
        <li>Budget travel: flights, SIM cards, insurance</li>
      </ul>
