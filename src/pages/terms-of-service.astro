        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing this website or using any services offered by DURIAN, you agree
          to be bound by these Terms of Service and our <a href="/disclaimer/" class="link">Disclaimer</a>.
          If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our website or services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Nature of Services</h2>
        <p>
          DURIAN provides educational strategy guidance on visa application preparation.
          Our services are strictly educational in nature. We do not provide legal advice, immigration
          legal services, or visa submission services. Please read the full <a href="/disclaimer/" class="link">Disclaimer</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>By using our services, you agree that you will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate and truthful information in all forms and sessions</li>
          <li>Not misuse our guidance to assist with fraudulent applications</li>
          <li>Take sole responsibility for the content and accuracy of your visa application</li>
          <li>Verify all requirements with the relevant embassy or consulate before applying</li>
          <li>Not share session content or written guidance with third parties for commercial purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Booking and Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
          Session bookings are confirmed by email. We require 24 hours notice for cancellations.
          Late cancellations (under 24 hours) may result in forfeiture of session fees for paid services.
          The free audit sessions are subject to reasonable scheduling constraints.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payment and Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Fees for paid sessions are due before or at the time of booking. Our services are billed
          for time and guidance, not for visa outcomes. Refusals of visa applications are not grounds
          for refund of service fees, as this would conflict with our disclaimer that no outcome is
          guaranteed or promised.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>

          is the intellectual property of DURIAN. You may use this content for personal,
          non-commercial purposes. You may not reproduce, publish, or distribute our content

        <h2>7. Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use our services or website to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create or assist with fraudulent or misleading visa applications</li>
          <li>Misrepresent yourself or provide false information</li>
          <li>Reverse engineer, copy, or commercially exploit our content</li>
          <li>Engage in any unlawful activity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          As detailed in our <a href="/disclaimer/" class="link">Disclaimer</a>, DURIAN's
          liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. We accept no liability for
          visa refusals, financial losses, or damages resulting from your use of our services.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of our services
          after changes are published constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by applicable law. Any disputes shall be resolved in accordance
          with the relevant jurisdiction.
        </p>
